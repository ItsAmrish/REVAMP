        The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, 
        while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. 
        The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. 
        Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, 
        are widely considered the first mass-produced[4][5] and mass-affordable[6][7][8] cars, respectively.
